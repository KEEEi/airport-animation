# airport simulator in C++
Simulating an airport where 8 planes go out on tours repeatedly. Each tour will be for exactly 12 passengers and last approximately 30 seconds. In performing the simulation, you must make sure that no plane tries to leave a gate with less (or more) than 12 passengers and that no plane lands or takes off at the same time as another plane is landing or taking off.  

When you excute a program, you have to put two variables. The first variable is that passengers which is the total number of passengers that are in the airport.
The second variable is that the sum total number of tours that all of the planes are to do. 


## Usage

For compiling instruction, type:
```
$ make
```
For execution instruction, type:
```
$ ./airport-animation <passengers> <tours>
```
